TITLE: simple linear regression
Task 2: Simple regression with one IV

DATA:

file = 'RegressionMplus.dat';
!this is a free format file

VARIABLE:

names = wcond class	w1sn02 w2sn02 w1int	w2int w1att	
        w2att z1pbc	z2pbc sqw1 sqw2;

usevariables = sqw1 sqw2;

!only the variables you need to use in the model



ANALYSIS:

estimator = ml; !maximum likelihood



MODEL:

sqw2 on sqw1; !ON defines regression 

!dependent ON independent 
!the DV always appears before ON
!the IV always appear after ON
    




OUTPUT: stand res sampstat; 
!stand: standardized results
!res = residuals
!sampstat: sample statistics
