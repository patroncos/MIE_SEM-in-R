TITLE: simple linear regression
Task 3: Multiple regression
with 1 continuous IV and 1 3 dummy variables


DATA:

file = 'RegressionMplus.dat';
!this is a free format file

VARIABLE:

names = wcond class	w1sn02 w2sn02 w1int	w2int w1att	
        w2att z1pbc	z2pbc sqw1 sqw2;

usevariables = sqw1 sqw2 wcond2 wcond3 wcond4;
!only the variables you need to use in the model
!new variables (wcond2-wcond4) are mentioned last




DEFINE: !defining 3 dummy variables
!creating 3 new variables with 0/1 values
!don't forget to add these in the usevariables above
!New variables need to always mentioned last 


wcond2 = 0; 
if (wcond == 2) then wcond2 = 1;
wcond3 = 0;
if (wcond == 3) then wcond3 = 1;
wcond4 = 0;
if (wcond == 4) then wcond4 = 1;




ANALYSIS:

estimator = ml; !maximum likelihood


MODEL:

sqw2 on sqw1 wcond2 wcond3 wcond4; 
!the outcome is predicted by sqw1 and the 3
!conditions



OUTPUT: stand res sampstat; 
!stand: standardized results
!res = residuals
!sampstat: sample statistics
