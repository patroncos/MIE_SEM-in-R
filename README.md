Here you will find the materials for the MIE Seminar/Workshops in R and Mplus.

## Session 1: Introduction to Mplus

This session was run by Margarita Panayiotou. The materials are available [*here*](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s690e0bt8accjnn/AADmMqI3D_7qua1mn96x7Pt2a?dl=0)


## Session 2: R basics

### Slides

The slides for this session are available [**here**](https://github.com/patroncos/MIE_SEM-in-R/blob/master/A%20brief%20Introduction%20to%20R%20(Part%201).pdf).

### Practical 1: Getting started with R

This is a gentle introduction to R. The practical is available [**here**](https://rpubs.com/patroncos/mie_seminar_s2_p1). 

The code for this tutorial is the file "Practical1.Rmd"

### Practical 2: GBBO demo 

This is a tutorial for basic data manipulation functions. The practical is available [**here**](https://rpubs.com/patroncos/mie_seminar_s2_p2). 

The code for this tutorial is the file "GBBO_Feb_2020.Rmd".

### Practical 3: Data manipulation and graphics

This is a tutorial that includes some data manipulation, descriptive statistics and graphics. The practical is available [**here**](https://rpubs.com/patroncos/mie_seminar_s2_p3).

The code for this tutorial is the file "Practical3.Rmd"

## Session 3: Regression in R and Mplus

### Slides

The slides for this session are available [**here**](https://github.com/patroncos/MIE_SEM-in-R/blob/master/Regression%20in%20R%20and%20Mplus.pdf).


### Practical 4: Linear regression

This is a tutorial designed to give a taster of what it's like to analyse data using linear regression. The data used is from a cluster randomised controlled trial.

#### The practical in R is available [**here**](https://rpubs.com/patroncos/mie_seminar_s3_p4)

The R code for this tutorial is the file "Practical4.Rmd"

#### The practical in Mplus is available [**here**](https://github.com/patroncos/MIE_SEM-in-R/blob/master/SEMinRs%20Session%203%20Regression%20in%20Mplus.pdf)

The data in Mplus-readable format (.dat) is available [**here**](https://github.com/patroncos/MIE_SEM-in-R/blob/master/RegressionMplus.dat)

### Practical 5: Binary logistic regression

This is a tutorial designed to give you a taster of what it's like to analyse data using binary logistic regression. This is when our outcome of interest is binary (0s and 1s). The data used is from a cluster randomised controlled trial.

The practical in R is available [**here**](https://rpubs.com/patroncos/mie_seminar_s3_p5)

The code for this tutorial is the file "Practical5.Rmd"
